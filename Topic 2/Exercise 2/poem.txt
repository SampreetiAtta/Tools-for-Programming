In Finland's hush, the pine trees rise,
Beneath the glow of northern skies.
Lakes like mirrors calm and wide,
Hold the secrets winds confide.

Auroras dance in winter's breath,
Above the snow-clad forest's depth.
Midnight sun on mossy ground,
Where silent beauty wraps around.

Nature speaks in tranquil grace,
In Finland's wild, enchanted place.
